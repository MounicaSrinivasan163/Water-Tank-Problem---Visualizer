# Water-Tank-Problem---Visualizer Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript  
*(Trapping Rain Water Problem)*
---
App : https://mounicasrinivasan163.github.io/Water-Tank-Problem---Visualizer/
---

A fully interactive frontend project that visualizes how much rainwater can be trapped between elevations (blocks). This implementation follows industry-standard coding practices and includes a clean SVG-based visualization.

---

# 📌 **1. Problem Statement**

You are given an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a block.  
Water is trapped between blocks when a block is shorter than the tallest blocks on its left and right sides.

### **Input**
An array of block heights:  
```
[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 4, 0]
```

### **Output**
Total trapped water:  
```
18 Units
```

### **Goal**
Build a **frontend web application** (Vanilla JS + HTML + CSS) that:  
✔ Takes block heights as input  
✔ Calculates trapped rainwater  
✔ Visualizes blocks + trapped water using SVG  

---

# 📊 **2. Data Table Example**

| Index | Block Height | Left Max | Right Max | Water Above |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 |
| 1 | 4 | 4 | 6 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 4 |
| 4 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| 8 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 0 |
| 9 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |

Total water = **18 units**

---

# 🧠 **3. How to Think About the Problem**

The trapped water above any block depends on:  
- **Tallest bar on the left**
- **Tallest bar on the right**
- **Current block height**

Water above index `i` is:

```
water[i] = min(maxLeft[i], maxRight[i]) − height[i]
```

If the result is negative → water[i] = 0.

---

# 🛠️ **4. Available Techniques / Algorithms**

### **A. Brute Force Approach (O(n²))**
For every block:  
- Find tallest block to the left  
- Find tallest block to the right  
- Compute trapped water  

❌ Very slow  
❌ Not scalable  
✔ Easy to understand  

---

### **B. Precomputed Left & Right Max Arrays — (Chosen Method)**
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

We create:  
- `leftMax[i]`: tallest block from 0…i  
- `rightMax[i]`: tallest block from i…end  

Then water[i] = min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) – height[i]

✔ Fast  
✔ Simple  
✔ Best for teaching + visualizing  
✔ Recommended for interviews  

---

### **C. Two-Pointer Method (Optimized O(n))**
No extra space, uses two pointers:

- Move left if leftMax ≤ rightMax  
- Otherwise move right  

✔ Fastest  
✔ Lowest memory  
❌ Harder to visualize  
❌ Code complexity is higher  

---

# 🎯 **5. Why We Chose the Left–Right Max Approach**

✔ Clean + intuitive logic  
✔ Easy to visualize  
✔ Great for front-end demo  
✔ Industry-standard interview solution  
✔ Works well with SVG block rendering  

---

# 🔍 **6. Algorithm Explanation (Step-by-Step)**

### **Step 1 — Precompute Left Max**
```
leftMax[0] = height[0]
leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i-1], height[i])
```

### **Step 2 — Precompute Right Max**
```
rightMax[n-1] = height[n-1]
rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i+1], height[i])
```

### **Step 3 — Calculate Water**
```
water[i] = min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]
if (water[i] < 0) water[i] = 0
```

### **Step 4 — Sum Water**
```
totalWater = sum(water[i])
```
